1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,280
Remember...

2
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,280
牢记

3
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:03,600
Nevra, wrap the case up for me.

4
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:03,600
内芙拉，梳理一下案情

5
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:06,040
Mehmet Yurtgil, Naimhan Turedi...

6
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:06,040
穆罕默德·尤特吉尔，纳伊姆汉·图雷迪

7
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,840
The last victim's name was Salih Guden.

8
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,840
最后一位受害者的名字是萨利赫·古登

9
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:11,360
Three victims. Scratch Tufan. Two of them are from Kambura.

10
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:11,360
除去图凡之外  三名受害者中有两人来自坎布拉

11
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,400
You've lived in Kambura for a while.

12
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,400
你在坎布拉住过很长一段时间

13
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,480
So all this does have something to do with Kambura.

14
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,480
所以这一切都与坎布拉有关

15
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,600
- It's Nazif! - Nazif?

16
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,600
-我是纳齐夫！-纳齐夫？

17
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,680
Do you know Agah Beyoglu?

18
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:24,680
你知道阿加·贝尤鲁吗？

19
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:29,040
The biggest favor you can do for such a sociopath is to talk about him.

20
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:29,040
你可以为这样的社会变态者做的最大的帮助就是谈论他

21
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:33,240
The one you chased all the way here... You never saw his face?

22
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:33,240
你一直在追逐的那个人  没看到他的脸吗？

23
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:36,480
Someone threw a torch at the house. It flared up...

24
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:36,480
有人向房子扔了火把

25
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,000
and burned the house down.

26
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,000
把房子烧了

27
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,080
You're talking too much...

28
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,080
你说的太多了

29
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,640
Something might happen to you.

30
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,640
你可能会发生什么事

31
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:45,760
Is it supposed to be a rabbit?

32
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:45,760
那是兔子吗？

33
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,360
No. It's a cat.

34
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,360
不，是猫

35
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:58,480
- Agah, you tired? - No, no, I'm fine.

36
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:58,480
-阿加，你累吗？-不，不，我没事

37
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,840
I know it was quite a walk, but these sprout only in the morning.

38
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,840
我知道这是很长一段路，但是这些植物只在早晨发芽

39
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:08,720
You almost missed me. I was just about to leave.

40
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:08,720
你差点错过，我就要走了

41
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,120
It was really surprising, seeing you standing there.

42
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,120
看到你真是令人惊讶

43
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,120
You haven't changed a bit. You look great.

44
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,120
你一点都没变  看起来很棒

45
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,600
- Neither have you, Seyfi. - Except for getting older, that is.

46
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,600
-你也没变  塞菲  -除了变老

47
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:34,360
Agah, when I'm your age, I hope to be...

48
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:34,360
阿加，当我到你这么老的时候，我希望我……

49
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,600
Look over there!

50
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,600
看那边！

51
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,440
There it is.

52
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,440
在那里

53
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,720
See this mushroom?

54
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,720
看到这个蘑菇吗？

55
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,960
This is a death cap.

56
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,960
这是一个毒蘑菇

57
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,600
One bite and you're dead.

58
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,600
一口就死了

59
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,240
It's that poisonous.

60
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,240
这是有毒的

61
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,960
Agah, what is that? What are you doing?

62
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,960
阿加，这是什么？你在做什么？

63
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,600
Where is Umut, Seyfi?

64
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,600
塞菲，乌穆特在哪里？

65
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:09,920
- The small intestine. It belongs... - There.

66
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:09,920
-小肠  属于……  -那里

67
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,880
Yes, there.

68
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,880
是的，那里

69
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,920
Where is Umut?

70
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,920
乌穆特在哪里？

71
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,760
- The large intestine. - The large intestine.

72
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,760
-大肠  -大肠

73
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,720
The large intestine. It belongs there.

74
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,720
大肠属于那里

75
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,120
- Where's Umut? - Fuck you!

76
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,120
-乌穆特在哪里？-去尼玛！

77
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,000
You've heard about astrology, right?

78
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,000
你听说过占星术吗？

79
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,720
It's a ridiculous idea.

80
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,720
那是个荒谬的行为

81
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,040
Where's Umut?

82
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,040
乌穆特在哪里？

83
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,600
You can't figure out someone's personality from their birth date.

84
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,600
你不能从某人的出生日期就看出他的个性

85
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,080
Let alone their future...

86
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,080
更不用说他们的未来

87
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,360
From their birth date? Impossible.

88
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,360
用出生日期开占卜？真不可思议

89
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,880
You know what works, though?

90
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,880
你知道什么可以吗？

91
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,480
Their birth place.

92
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,480
出生地

93
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:05,120
Where you're born dictates your personality and your future.

94
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:05,120
出生地决定了你的个性和未来

95
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,800
Astrology should take birth places into account.

96
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,800
占星术应该考虑出生地

97
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,640
Predictions made on birth places would be more plausible.

98
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,640
考虑到出生地的预测会更合理

99
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,960
In the end, children born in Tripoli,

100
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,960
最终，在的黎波里出生的孩子

101
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:26,000
Peshawar, or Angola

102
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:26,000
白沙瓦或安哥拉

103
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,240
will live pretty much identical lives.

104
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,240
将过着几乎相同的生活

105
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,560
And then there's Toronto, Oslo, Tokyo.

106
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:34,560
然后是多伦多，奥斯陆，东京

107
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,640
Those children, as well.

108
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,640
那些孩子也是一样

109
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,680
Our rural people are well aware of this fact.

110
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,680
我们的农村人民非常了解这一事实

111
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,160
That's why...

112
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,160
这就是为什么

113
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,640
This goes there.

114
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,640
这个在那里

115
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:53,280
They never ask someone they meet for the first time what their sign is.

116
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:53,280
人们从来没有问过他们第一次见面的人

117
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,680
They ask them where they're from.

118
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,680
问他们来自哪里

119
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:01,160
I won't ask you again. Will you talk?

120
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:01,160
我不会再问了，你说不说？

121
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,320
Will you talk?

122
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,320
说不说？

123
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,440
Wait.

124
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,440
等等

125
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,280
Speak into this.

126
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,280
对着这个说

127
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,320
Speak into this, you got that?

128
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,320
说吧，明白吗？

129
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,120
Speak into this.

130
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,120
对着它说

131
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,000
And then there's the rising sign.

132
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,000
应该有个上升星座

133
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,000
That corresponds to your citizenship.

134
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,000
那对应你的公民身份

135
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,280
What country you're born in.

136
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,280
你出生在哪个国家

137
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,760
That's important, as well.

138
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,760
这也很重要

139
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,760
A Syrian boy born in Syria does not share the same fate

140
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,760
在叙利亚出生的叙利亚男孩的命运

141
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,600
with a French boy born in Syria.

142
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,600
和一个在叙利亚出生的法国男孩不尽相同

143
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,920
My sign is Aleppo. My rising sign is French.

144
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,920
我的星座是阿勒普  我的上升星座是法国

145
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,080
That changes things.

146
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,080
这改变了一切

147
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,000
Or...

148
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,000
或者

149
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,920
My sign is Congo. My rising sign is Belgium.

150
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,920
我的星座是刚果  我的上升星座是比利时

151
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,480
It changes things.

152
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,480
这也改变了一切

153
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,000
And my sign is Kambura.

154
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,000
我的星座是坎布拉

155
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,840
So is my destiny.

156
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,840
命运也是一样

157
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:22,440
Whatever I've made of myself, I owe it all to being born in Kambura.

158
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:22,440
不管我做什么，我全都归功于在坎布拉出生

159
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:24,960
Go on.

160
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:24,960
去吧

161
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,080
Join your friends.

162
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,080
去找你的朋友吧

163
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,600
There's someone on the loose.

164
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,600
现在有人在外面

165
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,960
He's killed my brothers.

166
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,960
杀了我兄弟

167
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,400
He's shot my people from Kambura.

168
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,400
他在坎布拉枪杀了我的人

169
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,680
He's out there as we speak.

170
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,680
我们讲话时他在外面

171
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:50,760
And here you are, just standing there.

172
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:50,760
而你却站在这里

173
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,080
You're going to find him. Not to arrest him, Firuz.

174
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,080
你要找到他，但不要逮捕他，菲鲁兹

175
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,640
He is not to stand trial.

176
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,640
他不会接受审判

177
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:03,080
You will bring that son of a bitch to me, Firuz.

178
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:03,080
你把那个疯子交给我，菲鲁兹

179
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,200
I'll hold his trial,

180
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,200
我会审判他的

181
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,440
and I'll pass his judgement.

182
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,440
我会为他做出判决

183
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,520
- Is this a bad time, Cemil? - Come on in, Zuhal.

184
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,520
-现在不方便吗，塞米尔？-什么事，祖哈尔

185
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,480
You have a meeting with

186
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,480
在半小时后你有一个

187
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,840
our Middle Eastern representatives in half an hour.

188
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,840
与中东代表的会议

189
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,320
We should get back to the office.

190
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,320
我们应该回到办公室

191
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,280
What's your sign, Zuhal?

192
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,280
祖哈尔，你的星座是什么？

193
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,160
Capricorn.

194
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,160
摩羯座

195
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,440
But I don't really believe in signs.

196
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,440
但是我真的不相信星座

197
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,680
See? She doesn't believe in them, either.

198
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,680
看吗？她也不相信

199
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,880
Get back to work, and keep me posted.

200
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,880
回去工作，随时向我汇报

201
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,000
What's your sign?

202
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,000
你的星座是什么？

203
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,760
Dragon.

204
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,760
龙

205
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,920
Come visit us again soon, Tolga.

206
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,920
托尔加，不久再来看我们吧

207
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,880
I'd love that. Thank you for your hospitality.

208
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,880
我会的  谢谢你的招待

209
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,840
Goodbye.

210
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,840
再见

211
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,680
My mom's lying.

212
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,680
我妈妈在说谎

213
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:39,160
She didn't seem like she was lying.

214
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:39,160
她看起来不像在说谎

215
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,280
Her husband obviously has some problems.

216
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,280
但是她丈夫显然有一些问题

217
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,280
Might he have dreamt it all up?

218
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,280
真的只是做梦吗？

219
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,840
He might have.

220
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,840
有可能

221
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,000
Sir...

222
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,000
长官

223
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,000
You must have realized that my mom and I aren't very close.

224
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,000
你应该知道我和我妈妈关系不是很好

225
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,600
In fact, sometimes, I start doubting that I know her at all.

226
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,600
事实上，有时候我甚至怀疑自己是否认识她

227
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:05,080
But believe me, I can tell when she's lying.

228
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:05,080
但是相信我，我能看出她什么时候在说谎

229
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,480
Here's what we're going to do: I need to get back to the bureau.

230
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,480
我们要做的是：我需要回到局

231
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,400
Drop me off at the local precinct. I'll get a car there and go back.

232
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,400
让我在当地分局下车  我去那儿弄辆车回来

233
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,120
Call Sefa and call him over.

234
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,120
打电话给塞法  让他过来

235
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,600
Talk to the locals, see if anyone remembers the fire.

236
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,600
问问当地人，看看是否有人记得大火

237
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,720
- Is that clear? - Yes, sir.

238
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,720
-清楚吗？-是的 长官

239
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,800
Nevra...

240
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,800
内芙拉

241
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,920
If you don't come up with any leads about the fire today,

242
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,920
如果你今天找不出任何有关火灾的线索，

243
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
you're going to drop it. Alright?

244
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
就不要再找了，好吗？

245
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,400
Neither of us has any time to waste. Is that clear?

246
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,400
我们都没有时间可以浪费了，明白吗？

247
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,720
Yes, sir.

248
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,720
是  长官

249
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,640
Good. Drop me off, and get some rest while you're waiting for Sefa.

250
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,640
好，送我过去，你等着塞法，正好休息一下

251
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,600
Don't need that. You haven't slept, either.

252
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,600
不用了  你不是也没睡觉

253
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,400
I got a good night's sleep sometime last year.

254
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,400
我上次睡好觉是在去年

255
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,400
Let's go. Drop me off.

256
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,400
走吧，送我过去

257
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,440
Say you're sorry first.

258
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,440
先说对不起

259
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,840
Suveyda,

260
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,840
苏薇达

261
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,880
I said some...

262
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,880
我说了一些

263
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,360
stupid things about you.

264
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,360
关于你的谣言

265
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,200
Tell her exactly what you said.

266
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,200
告诉她你到底说了什么

267
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,360
I told people you were a whore.

268
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,360
我告诉别人你是妓女

269
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,160
I'm sorry.

270
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,160
对不起

271
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,480
Alright? Are we good?

272
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,480
可以了吗？

273
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,000
Tell her why.

274
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,000
告诉她为什么

275
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,000
I can tell her.

276
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,000
我可以告诉她

277
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,920
Because he asked you a question.

278
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,920
因为他问你一个问题

279
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,920
He wanted to be lovers.

280
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,920
他想做你的男朋友

281
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,960
But you didn't even give him a reply.

282
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,960
但是你甚至都没有给他回复

283
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,720
That made Afsin really mad.

284
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,720
那让阿夫辛发疯了

285
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:43,720
Because he's so dumb he doesn't realize that you've given up talking.

286
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:43,720
因为他太笨，他没有意识到你已经不屑跟他说话了

287
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,080
Hand it over.

288
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,080
给我

289
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,680
- I don't have it on me. - Where, then?

290
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,680
-我没带在身上 -那在哪里？

291
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,320
Come with me.

292
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,320
跟我来

293
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,920
Selim, go ahead to the car. I'll be right there.

294
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,920
塞利姆，上车  我马上就来

295
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,920
- Where are you going? - I'll be right there.

296
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,920
-你要去哪里？-我马上就来

297
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,680
Out for a ride, boys?

298
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,680
出去兜风吗？

299
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:33,480
- What are you doing here? - Nothing. Just standing here.

300
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:33,480
-你在这里做什么？-什么都没做  只是站在这里

301
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,440
Oh,

302
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,440
哦，

303
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,160
Vural, you'd know what to do.

304
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,160
乌拉尔，你会知道该怎么办

305
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,560
I have a gun.

306
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,560
我有枪

307
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,760
A really old one.

308
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,760
一把很古老的枪

309
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,080
Where can I take it to be repaired?

310
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,080
我拿到哪里可以修呢?

311
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,280
Why do you have a gun?

312
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,280
你带枪干嘛？

313
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:54,120
- I don't know. I just do. - What use would you have for it?

314
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:54,120
-我不知道  就是带了  -你用枪做什么呢？

315
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,880
I want to chase away the flies.

316
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,880
我想赶走苍蝇

317
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,760
Why would flies flee from a gun?

318
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,760
苍蝇为什么要从枪下逃走?

319
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,520
You do this.

320
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,520
你这样做

321
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,160
Nesrin,

322
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,160
内斯林

323
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:17,880
pointing a gun and shooting it are two very different things.

324
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:17,880
用枪指着和开枪是两码事

325
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:23,440
I've pointed a gun at someone only once in my life.

326
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:23,440
我这辈子只拿枪指过别人一次

327
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,600
It was my ex-husband.

328
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,600
那人是我的前夫

329
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,280
And I pulled my trigger.

330
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,280
然后我扣动扳机

331
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:37,240
But this is really old. It doesn't work, anyway.

332
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:37,240
但这枪真的很旧  反正不能用

333
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,160
I can show you. See?

334
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,160
我可以给你看  看到了吗?

335
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,800
It worked.

336
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,800
能用

337
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:51,280
Pity. I shot your tyre.

338
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:51,280
真可惜，我打中了你的轮胎

339
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,280
Better the tyre than one of you, though, right?

340
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,280
打中轮胎要比打中你们中的一个更好，对吧？

341
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,520
Alright, then.

342
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,520
那好吧

343
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,160
By the way, Ufuk...

344
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,160
顺便说一下   乌福克

345
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,040
Ask your mom over to my place for tea. Don't forget to tell her.

346
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,040
叫你妈妈到我家喝茶  别忘了告诉她

347
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,720
What have you done, Nesrin?

348
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,720
内斯林，你做了什么？

349
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,840
Don't you realize how dangerous they are?

350
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,840
你不知道有多危险吗？

351
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,680
Besides, where did you get that gun?

352
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,680
另外，你从哪儿拿到那把枪？

353
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,040
I went...

354
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,040
我去……

355
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,520
and talked to Sungur the pimp.

356
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,520
跟皮条客桑古尔谈了谈

357
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,840
I paid for it, too. So what?

358
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,840
我买来的，怎样？

359
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,920
You want me to just sit and watch while they threaten my husband?

360
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,920
你要我就这样看着他们威胁我的丈夫吗？

361
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,400
The real question is...

362
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,400
问题是

363
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,120
Where did you find that stone, Selim?

364
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,120
塞利姆，你在哪里找到那块石头？

365
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,400
It was really dark. Did you have to look long for it?

366
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,400
天很黑  你找了很久吗?

367
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:00,640
Or did you scramble to find it, to get a stone in yourself?

368
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:00,640
还是你自己抢来的？

369
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,040
Was that how it went?

370
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,040
那是怎么回事？

371
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,360
If you really did that,

372
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,360
如果你真的做了

373
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,680
then you're more dangerous than they are, Selim.

374
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,680
那你比他们更危险

375
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,520
Step aside.

376
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,520
靠边

377
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,600
Still no visitors.

378
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,600
仍然没有人拜访我

379
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,880
They must've forgotten about me.

380
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,880
他们一定忘了我

381
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,480
Don't be silly.

382
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,480
别傻了

383
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,680
Your daughter calls every day. She'd never forget about you.

384
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,680
你的女儿每天都在打电话  她永远不会忘记你

385
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,160
The shuttle was launched.

386
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,160
航天飞机发射了

387
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,960
The shuttle was launched but still no visitors.

388
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,960
航天飞机发射了，但仍然没有人来找我

389
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,120
They must've forgotten me here.

390
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,120
他们一定是忘了我

391
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,720
The shuttle was launched.

392
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,720
航天飞机发射了

393
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,640
Come on.

394
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,640
来吧

395
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,840
- Weren't you scared? - Just watch.

396
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,840
-你不怕吗？-看着

397
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,880
See the bloodstain?

398
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,880
看到血迹了吗？

399
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,840
The aquarium was busted, as well.

400
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,840
鱼缸也被打碎了

401
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,760
Suveyda. Come here.

402
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,760
苏薇达  过来

403
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,320
 Isn't that Mehmet Yurtgil?

404
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,320
那不是穆罕默德·尤尔吉尔吗？

405
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Point it at me.

406
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
指着我

407
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,800
That's it.

408
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,800
就这样

409
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,320
What did you do next?

410
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,320
接下来你做什么？

411
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,720
What do you think?

412
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,720
你觉得怎么样？

413
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,480
No way.

414
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,480
不可能吧

415
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,200
Right then and there?

416
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,200
就在那里？

417
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,960
Don't get too excited. We didn't record it.

418
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,960
别太兴奋  我们没有录制

419
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,040
Shit.

420
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,040
该死

421
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:46,720
Here you go. You can watch the rest of it later.

422
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:46,720
给你，你可以稍后看其他内容

423
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:52,360
You won't find the footage in there anywhere else.

424
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:52,360
在其他任何地方都找不到素材

425
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,040
We went to all the crime scenes.

426
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,040
我们去了所有犯罪现场

427
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,520
So? Did you find any clues?

428
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,520
那你找到任何线索了吗？

429
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,440
About who the guy might be, I mean.

430
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,440
我是说  凶手可能是谁

431
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:03,520
- That's not the point. - What is it, then?

432
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:03,520
-那不是重点  -那什么是重点？

433
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,080
Suveyda, show him.

434
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,080
苏薇达  给他看看

435
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,120
Nevra's cat.

436
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,120
内芙拉的猫

437
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,480
Cat cat psychopath.

438
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,480
猫猫精神变态

439
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,680
What is this?

440
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:19,680
这是什么？

441
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:23,760
Welcome to the fan club of Turkey's first legit serial killer.

442
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:23,760
欢迎来到土耳其首个合法的连环杀手粉丝俱乐部

443
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:28,120
We had to find a nickname for the guy. Like Jack the Ripper.

444
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:28,120
我们要先给杀手起个绰号，就像开膛手杰克

445
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:32,240
We wanted to find a nickname related to the stickers.

446
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:32,240
我们想找到一个与贴纸有关的绰号

447
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,400
- We decided to start calling him Stick. - Stick.

448
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,400
-我们最开始决定称他为贴纸男  -贴指男

449
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,080
That's good.

450
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,080
好啊

451
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:43,000
We wanted to call him Writer at first, but we decided it would be silly.

452
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:43,000
本来想称他为作家，但我们觉得很蠢

453
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,800
Then I thought about the cat costume.

454
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,800
然后我想到了猫服装

455
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,560
This is what we came up with.

456
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,560
这就是最终我们想出来的

457
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,880
- What are you doing? - Hold on.

458
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,880
-你在做什么？-别急

459
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,760
DOG SLAYER

460
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:53,760
狗杀手

461
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,680
- Here it is! - Holy fuck!

462
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,680
-就是它了  -卧槽！

463
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,720
That's a great name!

464
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:58,720
真是个好名字！

465
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:05,440
Suveyda didn't like it at all first. Killing dogs doesn't appeal to her.

466
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:05,440
苏薇达一开始就不喜欢  因为杀狗对她没有吸引力

467
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,840
But I explained to her that it had nothing to do with dogs.

468
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,840
但我向她解释说，这与狗无关

469
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,560
We all love dogs, right?

470
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,560
我们都爱狗，对吗？

471
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,840
But that's not the point. This is something else.

472
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:14,840
但不是重点  这是另外一回事

473
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,600
He's a cat. A cat that kills dogs.

474
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,600
他是猫  杀死狗的猫

475
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,920
The weak triumphing over the strong.

476
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,920
弱者胜过强者

477
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:27,000
It goes against everything we know. It goes against nature.

478
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:27,000
它违反了我们所知道的一切  违背了自然法则

479
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,840
I think that's awesome.

480
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,840
我觉得很棒

481
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,040
- I see. - We're almost there.

482
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:34,040
-我知道了-我们就快准备好了

483
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:37,040
Just some finishing touches on the website and we go live.

484
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:37,040
网站还有一些收尾的工作，然后我们就嫩上线了

485
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,200
What's missing?

486
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,200
还缺什么？

487
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,880
A forum asking a question: Whom would you like Dog Slayer to kill?

488
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,880
一个论坛的问题：你希望狗杀手杀死谁?

489
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,800
People will share on the forum whom they wish death on,

490
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,800
人们会在论坛上分享他们希望死亡的对象

491
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,440
and why they deserve to die.

492
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,440
以及为什么他们应该死

493
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,640
They will even vote on each other's victims.

494
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,640
他们甚至会投票给对方的受害者

495
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,000
A list will emerge.

496
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,000
一个死亡清单即将出现

497
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:56,080
Like a stock exchange but for prospective murder victims.

498
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:56,080
像证券交易所一样，但针对潜在的谋杀受害者

499
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,520
That's rad.

500
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,520
太棒了

501
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,880
Imagine Dog Slayer actually killing someone from that list.

502
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,880
想象一下杀是杀手真的杀死了名单上的某个人

503
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,400
Why not?

504
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,400
为什么不呢？

505
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,320
- Hold on. I'm almost done. - Sure.

506
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,320
-等一下  我快完成了  -当然

507
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:22,160
- Take the chair over there. - I'm fine standing.

508
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:22,160
-坐那边的椅子  -我站着就行

509
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:28,160
Have you ever heard about the village of Durucay?

510
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:28,160
你听说过杜鲁凯村吗？

511
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,640
I worked at the courthouse there for a while.

512
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,640
我在那儿的法院工作过一段时间

513
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:37,720
One day, our superiors told us we had to go to a mandatory seminar.

514
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:37,720
有一天，上司告诉我们，我们必须去参加强制性研讨会

515
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:42,960
Some Americans came and made a deal with the ministry.

516
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:42,960
一些美国人前来与该部达成协议

517
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,560
They were the ones holding the seminar.

518
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,560
他们是举行研讨会的人

519
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,720
Anyway...

520
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,720
总之……

521
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:52,280
I was working as a court clerk then. It's the most important job there.

522
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:52,280
那时候我是法院书记员，这是最重要的工作

523
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:55,920
You have to write each and every word down,

524
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:55,920
你必须写下每一句话，

525
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,680
never missing a single one.

526
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,680
永远不会漏掉任何一句

527
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:02,720
- I'll wash up and be right back. - What? Sure, sure.

528
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:02,720
-我会洗干净然后马上回来  -什么？好的

529
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,480
So we went to the seminar.

530
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,480
我们去了研讨会

531
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,480
They gave us these...

532
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,480
他们给我们发了这种……

533
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,720
These masks.

534
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,720
口罩

535
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:20,520
Stenomasks, they were called.

536
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:20,520
他们被称之为速记口罩

537
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:24,200
You speak into it. It's so sound-proofed that no one can hear what you're saying.

538
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:24,200
人们对着它说话非常的隔音，没人听见你在说什么

539
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:29,680
It's connected to a recorder that records everything you say.

540
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:29,680
它连接着一个录音机，录下你所说的一切

541
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,920
Anyway...

542
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,920
总之……

543
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,280
So they gave me one and I started using it.

544
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,280
他们给了我一个，我开始使用它

545
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:40,040
It was such a weird feeling, speaking and not having anyone hear you.

546
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:40,040
感觉很奇怪，说话时没有人听到你的声音

547
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:44,000
It was so impressive that I started seeing it in my dreams.

548
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:44,000
令人印象深刻，我开始在梦中看到它

549
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,680
For instance...

550
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,680
比方说

551
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,120
I'm in a crowded place in the dream.

552
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,120
我在梦中拥挤的地方

553
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:53,040
I speak and speak but no one can hear.

554
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:53,040
我会说话  但没人能听到

555
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,400
You know what happened a few days ago?

556
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,400
你知道几天前发生了什么吗？

557
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:01,920
I was waiting in line at the bank when a woman came to warn me.

558
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:01,920
我在银行排队等候时，一位女职员过来提醒我

559
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,480
She told me I was speaking to myself.

560
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,480
她说我是在自言自语

561
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:09,080
I was pretty shook up. Who knows what I'd told her.

562
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:09,080
我吓坏了  谁知道我跟她说了什么

563
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,720
- Would you like some tea? - No, thank you.

564
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,720
-要喝茶吗  -不，谢谢

565
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,840
It's funny how things change.

566
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,840
事情的变化很有趣

567
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:20,440
I used to be terrified that no one would hear what I said.

568
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:20,440
我曾经很害怕没有人会听到我说的话

569
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,560
Now, I'm terrified that they might.

570
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,560
现在，我很害怕他们可能会听到

571
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,080
I guess...

572
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,080
我猜……

573
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,560
That's life.

574
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,560
那就是人生

575
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,520
What's wrong with your car?

576
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,520
你的车怎么了？

577
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,960
My car's fine.

578
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,960
我的车很好

579
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,520
I'm the one with the problem.

580
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,520
我就是那个有问题的人

581
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,000
What have I done?

582
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,000
我做了什么？

583
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,520
I forgot to ask him where Ufuk lived.

584
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,520
我忘了问他乌福克住的地方

585
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,240
How am I supposed to find him now?

586
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,240
我现在应该怎么找到他？

587
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,680
Hello?

588
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:11,680
喂？

589
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,800
Hello? How do you answer this?

590
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,800
喂？这鬼东西怎么接啊？

591
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,400
Hello?

592
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,400
喂？

593
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,360
Hello? Ufuk?

594
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,360
喂？

595
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,200
How do you answer this?

596
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,200
怎么接啊？

597
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,200
Hello? Ufuk?

598
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,200
喂？乌福克？

599
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,960
You were so good at this stuff, Mebrure.

600
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,960
你曾经很擅长用这些东西，梅布鲁雷

601
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:40,320
You were so good at answering the phone and talking to the caller.

602
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:40,320
你很擅长接电话并和打电话的人交谈

603
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,600
I asked you to teach me how but you kept putting it off. Now look at me!

604
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,600
我让你教我怎么做，但是你一直拖着，现在你看我！

605
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,760
You went and left me, and here I am, all alone!

606
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,760
你走了，留下我一个人在这里!

607
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,720
What am I supposed to do now? Whom am I supposed to ask for help?

608
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,720
我现在该怎么办？我该找谁帮忙？

609
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:56,200
Am I supposed to ask them how to answer a phone?

610
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:56,200
我应该问他们如何接电话吗？

611
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,880
Won't they mock me?

612
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,880
他们不会嘲笑我吗？

613
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,400
An adult man who can't even answer a phone!

614
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:00,400
一个成年男人竟然不会接电话！

615
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:05,840
See what you did? I'm over here talking to myself!

616
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:05,840
看看你对我做了什么？我在这里自言自语！

617
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,360
He can't do anything! He can't even answer a phone!

618
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,360
他什么也做不了，甚至连电话都不会接！

619
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,360
I wouldn't be talking to myself if you were here.

620
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,360
如果你在这里我就不会自言自语了

621
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:14,680
That's what the woman at the bank said. I was talking to myself.

622
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:14,680
那是银行的女职员说的。我在自言自语

623
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,720
Yes, but no one will hear what I'm saying.

624
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,720
是的，但是没人会听到我在说什么

625
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,080
You don't hear what I'm saying.

626
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,080
你听不到我在说什么

627
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,280
You don't hear!

628
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,280
你听不到

629
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,480
No one listens! No one listens to me!

630
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,480
没有人听！没有人听我说！

631
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,360
No one!

632
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,360
没人！

633
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,840
- Good morning. - Good morning.

634
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,840
- 早上好  -早上好

635
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:07,320
- Have you been waiting long? - No. I just got here.

636
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:07,320
-等了很久吗 -没有，我刚到

637
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,800
Take me to the house.

638
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,800
带我去那房子

639
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,640
UFUK EXPECTING YOU FOR DINNER IN KAMBURA

640
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,640
乌福克：在坎布拉等你吃饭

641
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,080
You do hear me.

642
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,080
你听到了

643
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:51,760
You should've wished for something bigger.

644
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:51,760
你应该期望更大的目标

645
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,560
Just this morning, you said you wanted to see Kambura again,

646
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,560
就在今天早上，你说你想再看看坎布拉

647
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,400
and here we are, on our way there.

648
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,400
现在我们就在过去的路上

649
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,480
You're right.

650
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,480
是的

651
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:05,400
When you asked me to cancel all your meetings, I was concerned.

652
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:05,400
当你要求我取消所有会议时，我很担心

653
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:08,960
- Everything's alright, right? - Of course. Everything's alright.

654
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:08,960
-没事吧  -当然没事

655
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,680
I want to see an old friend.

656
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,680
我想见一个老朋友

657
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:16,200
We should have some fish. Our fish is unlike anywhere else's.

658
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:16,200
我们应该吃点鱼  那里的鱼与众不同

659
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,520
And some raki, as well.

660
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,520
再来些葡萄酒

661
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,680
You do drink, right?

662
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,680
你喝酒吧？

663
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:24,080
It doesn't really agree with me.

664
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:24,080
它真的不适合我

665
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,760
One glass of raki never hurt anyone.

666
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,760
一杯葡萄酒不会怎样的

667
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,000
I've seen much more implausible reports before.

668
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,000
我之前看过很多令人难以置信的报道

669
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:36,000
Reports declaring that a man shot from behind had killed himself.

670
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:36,000
报道称一名男子从背后开枪自杀

671
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:41,280
- Welcome to Kambura. - It's a nice place.

672
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:41,280
-欢迎来到坎布拉  -这是一个好地方

673
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,000
Like a fairy tale. Why don't you like it?

674
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,000
就像童话一样，你为什么不喜欢呢？

675
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:49,720
Here are the red riding hoods, and there are the wolves.

676
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:49,720
这里有小红帽和大灰狼

677
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:53,360
And mandatory happy endings no matter what comes to pass.

678
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:53,360
无论怎样都会有强制性的幸福结局

679
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:58,000
It's a fairy tale, alright. We just need to find the narrator.

680
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:58,000
这是童话，好吧，我们只需要找到一个讲故事的人

681
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,240
Selim or whomever it was that wrote that report.

682
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,240
塞利姆或撰写报告的人

683
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,640
Ufuk!

684
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,640
乌福克！

685
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,280
Ufuk, come and help me!

686
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,280
乌福克，过来帮帮我！

687
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,800
Ufuk, I'm talking to you!

688
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,800
乌福克，我在叫你！

689
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:22,800
- Let me finish my smoke. - Put it out!

690
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:22,800
-让我抽完烟  -把烟掐了！

691
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,880
Have you lost your mind! What are you doing!

692
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,880
你疯了吗！你在做什么！

693
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,680
What's one more scar?

694
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,680
还有什么伤疤?

695
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:36,480
Ufuk! Ufuk! Where are you going, son?

696
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:36,480
乌福克！乌福克！儿子，你要去哪里？

697
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:41,120
Has it been like this for ten years?  Why don't they tear it down?

698
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:41,120
十年来一直这样吗？为什么不把它拆了？

699
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:44,920
I think they're so used to seeing it that they don't even notice it anymore.

700
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:44,920
我想他们已经习惯了，甚至都没有注意到它

701
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,920
You can't tear down something you don't notice.

702
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,920
你不能拆毁你根本没有注意到的东西

703
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,800
The people lost in the fire...

704
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,800
人们在大火中迷失了自我

705
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:55,760
Tayyar Kaymak, 49. His wife, Songul Kaymak, 41.

706
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:55,760
49岁的塔亚尔·凯马克和他41岁的妻子松古尔·凯马克

707
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,120
And their five children.

708
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,120
还有他们的五个孩子

709
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,440
Seven people, all living in this tiny house?

710
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,440
七个人都住在这间小房子里？

711
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,400
I read something in a novel once.

712
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,400
我曾经读过一部小说

713
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,320
"Man takes less and less space the poorer he gets," it said.

714
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,320
书上说：“人越穷，占用的空间就越少。”

715
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,520
The poorer you are, the smaller you can make yourself.

716
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,520
越穷，就越小

717
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:22,040
So that's why the richer people get, the more space they need.

718
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:22,040
这就是为什么富人需要更多的空间

719
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:24,280
Explains the gigantic houses.

720
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:24,280
解释了他们问什么有巨大的别墅

721
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,960
How old was the youngest child?

722
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,960
最小的孩子几岁？

723
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,560
Four months old.

724
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,560
四个月大

725
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,640
Four months old.

726
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,640
四个月大

727
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,080
In such a tiny house.

728
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:34,080
在这么小的房子里

729
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:38,520
Could you go to sleep when you have a four-month-old here?

730
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:38,520
当你有一个四个月大的孩子时，你能睡着觉吗?

731
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,680
I don't remember what I did as a four-month-old.

732
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,680
我不记得我四个月大时做了什么

733
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:49,640
I'll tell you what you did. You cried nonstop.

734
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:49,640
你会不停地哭

735
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,240
So how come the report says

736
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,240
那报告怎么这样写

737
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:56,880
that they were presumed to have slept through the fire?

738
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:56,880
他们被推测在火灾中睡着了?

739
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,480
All of them.

740
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,480
全都睡着了

741
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:02,560
How's that possible? All seven of them, asleep.

742
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:02,560
那怎么可能呢？七个人都睡着了

743
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,800
I already told you.

744
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,800
我已经跟你说过

745
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,240
Whatever's in the report goes.

746
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,240
报告就是这样写的

747
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:10,360
Tayyar Kaymak had some priors, right?

748
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:10,360
塔亚尔·凯马克有一些前科，对吧？

749
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:13,480
Yes. Jailed twice, both times for burglary.

750
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:13,480
是的  两次入狱，两次都是入室盗窃

751
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:15,960
Burglary...

752
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:15,960
入室盗窃

753
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,920
If you were a thief...

754
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,920
如果你是小偷

755
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,280
would you be living in this place with six other people

756
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,280
你会和另外六个人住在这个地方吗

757
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,880
while also working the fields?

758
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,880
还在地里干活?

759
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,280
Never.

760
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,280
决不

761
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:31,720
I might start working the fields if I'd repented for my sins, though.

762
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:31,720
不过，如果我为自己的罪过忏悔，我可能会在田里干活。

763
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,120
Tayyar wasn't a thief.

764
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,120
塔亚尔不是小偷

765
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:44,160
Not a single one of the people who died in this house was a thief.

766
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:44,160
在这个房子里死去的人中没有一个是小偷

767
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,640
- So... - Ufuk.

768
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,640
-所以……-乌福克

769
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,480
Alright, Ufuk.

770
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,480
好的，乌福克

771
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,360
Where were you burnt?

772
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,360
你在哪里被烧伤的？

773
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,720
I was burnt here, as well.

774
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,720
我也时在这里被烧伤的

775
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,640
I was trying to save them.

776
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,640
我想救他们

777
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,760
Who started the fire?

778
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,760
谁扔的火把？

779
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,520
I did.

780
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,520
我扔的

781
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,040
I was standing right there.

782
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,040
我当时正站在那儿

783
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:27,000
Everything flared up in an instant. I was startled.

784
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:27,000
一切突然爆发了  我被吓了一跳

785
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,720
I thought they'd get out of the house after seeing the flames.

786
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,720
我以为他们看到火焰后会离开屋子

787
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,760
But no one get out. The fire was getting bigger.

788
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,760
但没人出门  火势越来越大

789
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:39,440
I could hear the screaming children inside.

790
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:39,440
我能听到里面的孩子在尖叫

791
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,400
I could hear the children's screams!

792
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,400
我能听到孩子们的尖叫声！

793
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:47,800
I ran to the door, but the door was chained and locked.

794
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:47,800
我跑到门口，但门被锁住了

795
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,000
 tried to break the chains, but I couldn't.

796
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,000
我试图打破锁链，但我做不到

797
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:54,680
I ran to the other window. It was shut, as well.

798
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:54,680
我跑到另一个窗口，但也被封锁了

799
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,320
I thought maybe...

800
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,320
我想也许

801
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,600
I couldn't get anyone out!

802
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,600
我无法把任何人救出来！

803
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,960
I shouted to the crowd! Help me, I said!

804
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,960
我向人群大喊！帮帮我！

805
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,920
 Let's break the chains together! Somebody help me!

806
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,920
我们把锁链打开！来人帮帮我！

807
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,680
Nobody helped! Nobody broke the chains!

808
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,680
没有人帮助！没有人打开铁链！

809
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,200
Nobody came! Nobody helped me!

810
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,200
没人来！没人帮助我！

811
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:15,840
- Then... - Ufuk!

812
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:15,840
-然后……  -乌福克

813
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,720
Ufuk!

814
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,720
乌福克！

815
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,320
- Ufuk. - What?

816
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,320
-乌福克  -什么

817
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,560
Who chained the doors?

818
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,560
谁把门锁住了？

819
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:32,160
I asked them who did. They told me there were no chains.

820
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:32,160
我问他们是谁锁的  但他们告诉我没有锁链

821
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,120
I was supposedly...

822
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,120
我应该是

823
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:38,040
I was burnt while trying to rescue the family.

824
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:38,040
我在营救他们时被烧伤了

825
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,880
A falling beam hit me on the head.

826
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,880
落下的横梁击中了我的头

827
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:42,440
Ufuk, here's what we're going to do.

828
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:42,440
乌福克，我们接下来这样做

829
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,160
- Ufuk, we're going... - Arrest me!

830
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,160
-Ufuk，我们要……  -逮捕我！

831
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,880
- Sure, alright. - Arrest me!

832
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,880
-当然可以  -逮捕我！

833
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,720
- Come with me. - Arrest me!

834
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,720
-跟我来  -逮捕我！

835
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,200
- Sure. Fine. - I killed those children. Arrest me!

836
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,200
-好的  -是我杀了那些孩子  快逮捕我！

837
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,160
- Sure. - Please!

838
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,160
-好的  -请！

839
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,800
- Let's talk for a bit. - My face was burnt here!

840
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,800
-让我们谈谈-我的脸就是在这里被烧伤了！

841
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,360
- Sure, come with me. - Arrest me, please arrest me!

842
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,360
-当然，跟我来  -逮捕我，请逮捕我！

843
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,440
- Sure, I will. - Arrest me! See my scars?

844
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,440
-当然，我会的  -逮捕我！看到我的伤疤了吗？

845
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,880
- Sure. - I burnt the house down!

846
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,880
-当然  -是我把房子烧毁了！

847
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,280
- I understand. - I killed those children.

848
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,280
-我知道  -我杀了那些孩子

849
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:06,160
- Alright, alright. - Please arrest me.

850
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:06,160
-好的  -请逮捕我

851
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,480
Look at that house!  I'm the one who burnt it down!

852
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,480
看那所房子！我是烧毁它的人！

853
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:13,160
- I understand. - The children! I burnt it all down!

854
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:13,160
-我明白了  -还有孩子们！我把它全部烧掉了！

855
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:34,720
- The boy's talking. - Leave him be.

856
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:34,720
-他说了  -别管他了

857
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,720
Let him talk.

858
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,720
让他说吧

859
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:48,920
- You still haven't gotten married? - No.

860
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:48,920
-你还没结婚吗  -没有

861
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,240
Of course.

862
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,240
当然

863
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:55,760
You already have a wife, right?

864
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:55,760
你已经有老婆了吧？

865
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,160
- Kambura. - That's right.

866
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,160
-坎布拉  -是的

867
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,440
Why did you call me here, Cemil?

868
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,440
你为什么给我打电话，塞米尔？

869
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,760
What do you want from me?

870
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,760
你想从我这里得到什么？

871
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,240
What are you doing with that gun?

872
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,240
你用那把枪做什么？

873
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,400
Blowing out tyres.

874
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,400
打轮胎

875
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,240
I heard.

876
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,240
我听说了

877
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,400
I heard it all the way in Istanbul.

878
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,400
我在伊斯坦布尔就听说了

879
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,320
I'm sure it did.

880
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,320
当然了

881
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,120
Selim will be alright, Nesrin.

882
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,120
内斯林，塞利姆会没事的

883
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,320
No one's going to hurt him.

884
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,320
没有人会伤害他

885
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,040
All we ask...

886
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,040
我只是想问……

887
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:31,480
- Is that his imaginary remorse... - Imaginary?

888
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:31,480
-那是他想象中的悔恨……—想象中的?

889
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,480
Exactly.

890
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,480
正是

891
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:35,400
He should keep it to himself.

892
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:35,400
他应该保密的

893
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,040
Quietly.

894
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:37,040
悄悄的

895
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:41,280
Let's say you successfully shut Selim up.

896
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:41,280
假设你成功让塞利姆闭嘴了

897
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,800
What will you do with Ufuk?

898
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,800
你会对乌福克做什么？

899
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:51,000
How will you shut that poor boy up?

900
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:51,000
你怎么让那个可怜的男孩闭嘴？

901
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,960
Why would I shut him up?

902
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:53,960
我为什么要把他闭嘴？

903
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,960
He's talking as we speak.

904
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,960
在我们聊天的同时他正在说

905
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,040
Talking to whom, you may ask.

906
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,040
你可能会问他在跟谁说

907
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:04,040
He's talking to that beautiful daughter of yours.

908
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:04,040
他在跟你那个美丽的女儿说话

909
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:09,120
Nevra doesn't realize that Ufuk is a troubled man.

910
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:09,120
内芙拉没有意识到乌福克是个很麻烦的人

911
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:15,000
For years now, he's confessed to arson to every cop he ran across.

912
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:15,000
多年来，他对他遇到的每个警察都承认纵火

913
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:18,400
You should let Nevra know the next time you see her.

914
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:18,400
下次见到内芙拉时，你应该告诉她

915
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,080
He is a certified loon. He doesn't know what he's saying.

916
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,080
他是一个疯子  他根本不知道自己在说什么。

917
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:28,440
Don't you ever wonder what really happened?

918
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:28,440
你难道不想知道到底发生了什么吗？

919
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:31,440
- About? - The truth.

920
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:31,440
-关于什么？  -真相

921
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,480
No.

922
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,480
不想

923
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,880
So you don't want to know.

924
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,880
所以你根本不想知道

925
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,960
I'm loyal to my wife, Nesrin.

926
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,960
我忠于我的妻子  内斯林

927
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,600
You know what true loyalty is?

928
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,600
你知道什么是真正的忠诚吗？

929
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,160
Never questioning.

930
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,160
永不质疑

931
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,520
In other words, deceiving yourself.

932
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,520
换句话说，欺骗自己

933
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,680
Have you ever...

934
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,680
你有没有……

935
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:04,000
loved anyone so much that you'd never question anything?

936
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:04,000
像这样爱过什么人，你永远都不会质疑任何事情？

937
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,920
Have you ever...

938
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,920
你有没有……

939
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:09,520
believed in something no matter what?

940
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:09,520
不论发生什么都会一直坚信某件事？

941
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,320
Of course not. Never.

942
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,320
当然没有，从没有过

943
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,600
I guess...

944
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,600
我猜……

945
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,400
you must've never had a family, Nesrin.

946
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,400
你一定从未拥有过家庭，内斯林

947
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:32,960
KAMBURA POLICE DEPARTMENT

948
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:32,960
坎布拉警察署

949
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,760
You didn't cuff me.

950
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,760
你没给我戴手铐

951
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:39,120
- You promised you'd arrest me. - Don't you realize the state he's in?

952
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:39,120
-你答应过要逮捕我  -你不知道他什么状态吗？

953
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,800
Let us talk to him and we will.

954
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,800
让我们跟他谈

955
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:44,040
Thank you for all your help.

956
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:44,040
谢谢你的帮助

957
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,440
Tell it from the beginning.

958
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,440
从最开始说起

959
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:50,280
- I already did. - Tell it again.

960
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:50,280
-我已经说过了  -再说一次

961
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,400
How many times do I need to tell it?

962
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,400
我需要说多少次？

963
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,320
I thought you were proper cops. I burnt the house down!

964
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,320
我以为你们是真正的警察  是我把房子烧毁了！

965
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:59,120
I killed all those people! What else is there to say?

966
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:59,120
我杀了他们！还有什么要说的？

967
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,440
It seems you won't do your job, either.

968
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:03,440
看来你也不会抓我的

969
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,560
I'm not telling you anything.

970
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,560
我什么都没告诉你

971
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:10,120
I'll keep telling it to myself.

972
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:10,120
我将会继续告诉自己

973
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,080
I'm so sick of this. I'm so sick of it.

974
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,080
我很讨厌这样  我很讨厌

975
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:16,480
I can do it myself. I don't need you.

976
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:16,480
我自己可以做  不需要你

977
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,520
Where do you think you're going?

978
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,520
你以为你要去哪里？

979
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,320
Where do you think you're going!

980
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,320
你以为你要去哪里？

981
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:25,240
You're just standing there. You haven't even put me in cuffs!

982
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:25,240
你只是站在那儿  你甚至都没有把我戴上手铐！

983
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,360
Fuck you and your cuffs!

984
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,360
去尼玛的手铐！

985
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:33,200
You there! Look here! Come here! Quick!

986
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:33,200
你！这边！过来！快！

987
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,800
Give me that!

988
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,800
手铐给我！

989
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,240
Hold out your hands! Hold them out!

990
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,240
伸出双手，伸出双手！

991
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:45,600
There you go! There's your cuffs!

992
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:45,600
好了！现在你有手铐了！

993
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,000
Let me talk to him alone.

994
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,000
让我跟他单独谈谈

995
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,560
Are you sure?

996
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,560
你确定吗？

997
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:56,000
I'll be right outside. Yell if you need anything.

998
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:56,000
如果你需要什么，我就在门口

999
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:17,280
You were the one I was chasing that night, right?

1000
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:17,280
你就是那天晚上我追的那个人，对吗？

1001
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,880
Why did you want me to see it, Ufuk?

1002
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,880
乌福克，你为什么要我看到它？

1003
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:25,520
Why did you want the truth to come out after all these years?

1004
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:25,520
过了这么多年，你为什么要现在说出真相？

1005
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,360
After all these years?

1006
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,360
过了这么多年？

1007
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,560
I've been imploring the cops ever since the incident.

1008
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,560
自事件发生以来我一直在恳求警察

1009
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:34,640
Telling them that I did it. That they should arrest me.

1010
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:34,640
告诉他们是我做的  他们应该逮捕我

1011
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,840
I've been shouting it from the rooftops for ten years.

1012
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,840
我已经说了十年

1013
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,480
But no one will listen.

1014
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,480
但是没人听

1015
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,440
Then they leave.

1016
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,440
然后他们离开这里

1017
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,760
Others take their place.

1018
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,760
其他人接替他们的位置

1019
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,640
I tell them. They don't listen, either.

1020
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:51,640
我告诉他们  他们也不听

1021
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,280
I heard Nesrin's daughter had become a cop.

1022
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,280
听说内斯林的女儿当了警察

1023
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:56,960
I thought that maybe...

1024
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:56,960
我以为

1025
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,680
Maybe she'd listen to me.

1026
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,680
也许她会听我的

1027
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,160
But how was I supposed to find you?

1028
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,160
但是我应该怎么找到你呢？

1029
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:08,280
Then, one day, you appeared in Kambura.

1030
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:08,280
然后，有一天你突然出现在坎布拉

1031
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,120
Do you have any trash, Naz?

1032
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,120
纳兹，你有垃圾吗？

1033
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,440
Your door's unlocked.

1034
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,440
你的门没锁

1035
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,400
Naz?

1036
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,400
纳兹？

1037
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,680
Are you home? It's Seyit.

1038
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,680
你在家里吗？我是塞菲

1039
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:41,200
Who else was there with you on the night of the fire?

1040
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:41,200
火灾当晚还有谁跟你在一起？

1041
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,600
I don't remember.

1042
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,600
我不记得了

1043
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,280
But everyone was there. I'm sure of it.

1044
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,280
但是我很确定所有人都在那里

1045
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,520
Alright.

1046
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,520
好的

1047
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:52,320
If Tayyar Kaymak never stole anything,

1048
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:52,320
如果塔亚尔·凯马克从未偷过任何东西

1049
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:56,120
why did that crowd gather outside his house, aiming to kill him?

1050
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:56,120
那为什么那群人聚集在他的房子外面，并且要杀死他？

1051
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,360
Why else?

1052
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,360
怎么会这样

1053
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,840
Because they were gypsies.

1054
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,840
因为他们是吉普赛人

1055
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,480
Because they were gypsies?

1056
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,480
因为他们是吉普赛人？

1057
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:06,920
You're telling me that all those people, all those children...

1058
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:06,920
你是在告诉我所有人，包括那些孩子

1059
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,240
They were killed because they were Romani?

1060
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,240
他们被杀是因为他们是吉普赛人？

1061
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:14,080
- That's the only reason? - Yes. It's enough.

1062
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:14,080
-那是唯一的原因吗？-是的

1063
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,560
How do you know that? Who told you?

1064
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,560
你怎么知道的？谁告诉你的？

1065
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,040
Nobody told me.

1066
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,040
没人告诉我

1067
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,360
Nobody told me, because...

1068
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,360
没人告诉我，因为

1069
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,600
I remember it all too well.

1070
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,600
我记得很清楚

1071
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:30,080
I don't remember exactly who was there.

1072
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:30,080
我不记得是谁

1073
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,520
But I remember very well...

1074
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,520
但我记得很清楚

1075
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:38,000
what I said, what I shouted out as I was throwing that torch.

1076
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:38,000
我说的是什么，我在扔那个火炬时大喊

1077
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,920
What were you saying, Ufuk?

1078
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,920
你在喊什么，乌福克？

1079
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,760
"Fuck off out of Kambura!"

1080
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,760
“滚出坎布拉！”

1081
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,880
"Get out, you filthy gypsies!"

1082
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,880
“滚出去，你们这些肮脏的吉普赛人！”

1083
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:50,920
I TOLD NEVRA EVERYTHING BUT SHE WON'T BELIEVE ME.

1084
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:50,920
我把一切都告诉了内芙拉，但她不相信我

1085
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,520
Our beautiful apartment is going to be all over the news.

1086
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,520
我们美丽的公寓将会上新闻

1087
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:57,080
You demon. You're going to bring misfortune upon us.

1088
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:57,080
你这个恶魔，你会给我们带来不幸

1089
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:58,200
The newspaper told me

1090
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:58,200
报纸上说

1091
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:03,160
that I'd be getting paid for the tip. How much you think I'll get?

1092
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:03,160
我可以获得情报的报酬  我能得到多少？

1093
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,440
I'll give you the money.

1094
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,440
我给你钱

1095
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:12,360
Maybe he had a special friend. Maybe he did it.

1096
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:12,360
他可能有一个特殊的朋友，可能是他做的

1097
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:17,120
You think she was selling herself? What do you think?

1098
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:17,120
你认为她在出卖身体吗？你怎么看？

1099
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,800
I doubt she was selling herself.

1100
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,800
我不认为她在出卖自己的身体

1101
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,080
Unlike you.

1102
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,080
不像你

1103
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:29,080
Don't be like that. Go on, leave.

1104
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:29,080
不要那样，走吧

1105
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:35,320
- Let him go! - Let the poor boy go!

1106
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:35,320
-让他走！-让可怜的男孩走！

1107
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,440
Do you want us to come and get him?

1108
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,440
你要我们冲进去找他吗？

1109
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,160
- Huh? - My son!

1110
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,160
-嗯 -我儿子

1111
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:42,600
My son! Don't be scared. I won't leave you in there!

1112
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:42,600
我的儿子！不要害怕  我不会把你留在那里！

1113
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,400
I won't let anyone hurt you!

1114
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,400
我不会让任何人伤害你！

1115
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,120
Let me go!

1116
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,120
让我走！

1117
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:52,320
He's certified! Certified, I'm telling you! My son is sick!

1118
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:52,320
他有诊断！我告诉你！我儿子病了！

1119
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,720
Let him go! Son! Ufuk!

1120
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,720
放开他！儿子！乌福克！

1121
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,360
Ufuk!

1122
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,360
乌福克！

1123
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,240
He's certified!

1124
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,240
他有诊断！

1125
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,040
He really is certified.

1126
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,040
他真的有诊断

1127
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:22,840
States that he's in poor mental health. He can't be held liable.

1128
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:22,840
声明他精神状况不佳  他不用承担任何责任

1129
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:26,920
I tried telling you, but you wouldn't listen.

1130
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:26,920
我试着告诉过你，但你不听

1131
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,600
DIAGNOSIS: IN POOR MENTAL HEALTH

1132
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,600
诊断：精神健康状况不佳

1133
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,040
Sefa, listen to me carefully.

1134
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,040
塞法  认真听我说

1135
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:45,480
Keep your wits about you, and stay in the building.

1136
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:45,480
保持警惕，待在楼里

1137
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,240
I've sent you back-up. They'll be there soon.

1138
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,240
我已经发给你一份备份  很快就会到

1139
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,560
They'll get both you and the suspect out of there.

1140
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,560
可以把你们和犯罪嫌疑人带出去

1141
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,040
What?

1142
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,040
什么？

1143
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:55,240
I take all responsibility. Just bring the guy to me.

1144
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:55,240
我承担所有责任  一定要把那个家伙带给我

1145
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,520
- Go! - Understood, sir.

1146
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,520
-去吧  -明白  长官

1147
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,280
I think I've had enough.

1148
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,280
我不喝了

1149
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:08,840
Come on. You've had only one glass.

1150
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:08,840
来吧  你只喝了一杯

1151
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:13,040
Besides, it's really hard to drink too much in Kambura.

1152
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:13,040
另外，在坎布拉喝酒真的很难

1153
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,320
How was the meeting?

1154
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,320
聚会怎么样？

1155
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,640
- What? - How was your meeting?

1156
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,640
-什么？-你的聚会怎么样？

1157
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,120
Oh. Good, it was good.

1158
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,120
哦，很好，很好

1159
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:26,240
I met an old acquaintance, from back when your father was here.

1160
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:26,240
我遇到了一个老相识，还是你父亲在这儿的时候认识的

1161
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,440
Funny.

1162
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,440
真有趣

1163
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:32,960
You might know my father better than I do.

1164
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:32,960
你可能比我更了解我的父亲

1165
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,760
What do you want?

1166
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,760
你想要什么？

1167
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,680
Excuse me.

1168
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,680
请原谅

1169
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,520
Yes?

1170
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,520
喂？

1171
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,440
What?

1172
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,440
什么？

1173
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:53,600
Taking him to Istanbul?

1174
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:53,600
带他去伊斯坦布尔？

1175
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:58,640
Don't let them take him away. I don't care how.

1176
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:58,640
无论如何不能让他们把他带走

1177
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,000
Don't disappoint me.

1178
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,000
别让我失望

1179
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:03,880
Got it?

1180
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:03,880
明白吗？

1181
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:07,920
Everyone might know my father better than I do.

1182
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:07,920
可能任何人都比我更了解我父亲

1183
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,320
Yes...

1184
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,320
好了……

1185
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,640
Let him go! Let my son go!

1186
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,640
放了他！让我儿子走！

1187
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:30,600
Take him away! Take him away right now!

1188
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:30,600
把他带走！马上带他走！

1189
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,720
Feza? It's your turn. Feza

1190
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,720
费扎？轮到你了

1191
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:12,960
Go on.

1192
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:12,960
来吧

1193
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:18,400
She has a beautiful voice.  Wait 'til you hear it.

1194
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:18,400
她有一副好嗓子  等着听

1195
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,920
Go on, Feza. They're all listening

1196
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,920
来吧费扎  他们都在听

1197
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:03,120
Here you go, Feza.

1198
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:03,120
来吧  费扎

1199
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:08,480
My head is foamy cloud.

1200
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:08,480
我的头是泡沫状的云

1201
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:13,560
My head is foamy cloud.

1202
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:13,560
我的头是泡沫状的云

1203
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:16,880
My inside and outside is a sea.

1204
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:16,880
我的内外都是大海

1205
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:21,360
I'm a walnut tree in Gulhane Park.

1206
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:21,360
我是古尔哈内公园的一棵核桃树

1207
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:28,280
An old walnut tree. With long branches and pieces.

1208
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:28,280
一棵老核桃树，长着树枝和碎片

1209
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:30,440
Neither you are aware of this

1210
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:30,440
你不知道

1211
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:33,040
nor is the police.

1212
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:33,040
警察也不知道

1213
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:43,360
Whenever I recite that poem,

1214
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:43,360
当我背诵这首诗时

1215
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:45,800
I feel as I'm traveling into space.

1216
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:45,800
我感觉我正在太空旅行

1217
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:58,520
If you won't do it,

1218
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:58,520
如果你不这样做

1219
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:02,000
then I'll do it myself.

1220
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:02,000
那我自己去做

1221
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:06,480
I'll do it myself, alright. I'll show all of you.

1222
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:06,480
我就自己做，我会证明给大家看

1223
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:42,240
What's he doing in there?

1224
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:42,240
他在里面做什么？

1225
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:49,560
What's he up to?

1226
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:49,560
他在干什么？

1227
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:54,720
Ufuk!

1228
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:54,720
乌福克

1229
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:58,520
Ufuk, come on!

1230
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:58,520
乌福克，出来吧

1231
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:04,760
Shit.

1232
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:04,760
该死！

1233
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:08,280
Shit!

1234
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:08,280
该死！

1235
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:09,880
Shit!

1236
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:09,880
该死！

1237
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:13,040
Shit, shit, shit!

1238
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:13,040
该死！，该死，该死！

1239
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:17,280
What are you doing, just standing there, you dumbass?

1240
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:17,280
你在干什么，怎么搞的，笨蛋？

1241
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,960
Attention all units, I repeat:

1242
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,960
所有单位请注意，我重复一遍：

1243
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:05,600
The suspect is 1.79 tall and weighs 70 kilos.

1244
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:05,600
犯罪嫌疑人身高179体重70公斤

1245
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:09,760
He has distinctive burn marks on his face. His name is Ufuk Terazi.

1246
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:09,760
他的脸上有明显的烧伤痕迹。他的名字叫乌福克·泰拉齐

1247
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:11,760
- Clear. - Where could he have run to?

1248
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:11,760
-没看到他 -他会去哪里？

1249
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:13,080
- Check his home. - Where?

1250
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:13,080
-去他家看看  -在哪里？

1251
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:14,400
We should check his home.

1252
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:14,400
我们应该去检查他的家

1253
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:17,280
What's going on here?

1254
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:17,280
这里发生了什么？

1255
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:23,120
We don't have time for this.

1256
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:23,120
没时间跟你废话

1257
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:30,000
What's going on here? What's going on?

1258
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:30,000
这是怎么回事？这是怎么回事？

1259
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:33,120
Get out of our way.

1260
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:33,120
离开这

1261
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,800
- What do they want? - They want the kid, sir.

1262
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:35,800
-他们想要什么？-他们要乌福克，长官

1263
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:41,560
Hello there.

1264
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:41,560
你好啊

1265
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:45,280
- Stay back. Don't come any closer. - Sure, I won't.

1266
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:45,280
-不要靠近我  -当然，我不会

1267
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:47,000
It all ends here.

1268
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:47,000
一切到此为止

1269
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:49,440
You can't change my mind.  I'm going to do it.

1270
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:49,440
你不能改变我的主意

1271
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:52,720
- I won't interfere. As you were.- Who are you?

1272
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:52,720
-我不会干涉你  -你是谁？

1273
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:56,120
- I'm just going to need the knife back.- What knife?

1274
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:56,120
-我只想要回小刀  -什么刀？

1275
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:01,120
- It was you? - Yes.

1276
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:01,120
 -刚刚那是你吗？-是的

1277
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:05,360
- How did you know I'd be there? - I'm from Kambura, after all.

1278
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:05,360
-你怎么知道我会去那里的？-毕竟我也来自坎布拉

1279
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:10,000
We all know about that place. Escapers Central, you might call it.

1280
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:10,000
大家都知道那个地方，你可以称之为越狱中心

1281
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:12,640
Tevfik made his jailbreak there.

1282
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:12,640
陶菲克曾在那个地方越狱

1283
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:17,480
Everybody knows about it. They used to tell it like a fairy tale.

1284
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:17,480
大家都知道  他们过去常常把它讲得像童话故事一样。

1285
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:19,960
They must've told it to you, as well, huh?

1286
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:19,960
他们也一定告诉过你，对吧？

1287
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:21,960
I've never seen you before.

1288
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:21,960
我从没见过你

1289
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:23,760
Are you from Kambura?

1290
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:23,760
你来自坎布拉吗？

1291
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:27,800
In actual fact, Tevfik had that place built.

1292
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:27,800
实际上，陶菲克建了那个地方

1293
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:30,800
When he heard he was going to be transported

1294
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:30,800
当他听说他要被转运到

1295
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:32,840
to a prison in Istanbul, he called his men.

1296
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:32,840
伊斯坦布尔的监狱时，他召集他的手下

1297
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:35,360
Told them to construct a public bathroom on the highway.

1298
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:35,360
告诉他们在高速公路上建造一个公共厕所

1299
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:38,640
He'd ask the cops to stop there and run out the window.

1300
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:38,640
他要警察在那里停下，然后他从窗户逃跑

1301
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:40,680
The Can, they used to call it.

1302
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:40,680
他们曾经称它为罐子

1303
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:42,680
The Can.

1304
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:42,680
罐子

1305
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:45,680
Escape Central, as it later became known.

1306
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:45,680
后来越狱中心渐渐被人们所熟知

1307
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:48,960
How many years it must've been...

1308
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:48,960
已经过去好多年了啊……

1309
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:51,480
What do you want from me? Why did you help me?

1310
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:51,480
你想从我这里得到什么？为什么要帮助我？

1311
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:56,040
You texted your brother Umut telling him you were going to kill yourself.

1312
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:56,040
你给你的弟弟乌穆特发了短信，告诉他你将要自杀

1313
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:58,160
What was that you said?

1314
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:58,160
你说什么？

1315
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:02,800
"The woman cop is back in Kambura."

1316
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:02,800
“女警察回到坎布拉”

1317
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:05,120
I'm going to tell them everything.

1318
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:05,120
我要告诉他们一切

1319
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:08,480
"Either they jail me or I kill myself."

1320
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:08,480
“他们要么抓我入狱，要么我自杀”

1321
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:12,840
- How do you know about my text to Umut? - So I... Let me speak.

1322
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:12,840
-你怎么知道我发给乌穆特的短信？-所以我……让我说完

1323
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:15,120
Let me speak. I'm trying to tell you a story.

1324
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:15,120
让我说完  我想告诉你一个故事

1325
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:18,640
I saw them taking you away.I saw the crowd outside,

1326
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:18,640
我看到他们把你带走  我看到外面的人群

1327
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:23,000
telling them to let you go, telling them you're certified.

1328
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:23,000
让警察放了你，告诉警察说你有诊断

1329
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:27,160
I decided to wait in Escape Central.You never know, right?

1330
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:27,160
我就决定在越狱中心等待你  世事难料，对吧？

1331
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:31,240
How do you know about my text to Umut?

1332
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:31,240
你怎么知道我发给乌穆特的信息？

1333
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:32,960
Where is he? Is Umut here as well?

1334
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:32,960
他在哪里？乌穆特也在这里吗？

1335
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:36,040
No, son. Umut isn't here.

1336
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:36,040
不，孩子  乌穆特不在这

1337
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:40,000
- He's the one who sent you. - You could say that.

1338
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:40,000
-是他让你来的  -你可以这么说

1339
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:44,600
- So you know Umut? - Do I know him? Of course!

1340
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:44,600
-所以你认识Umut吗？-我认识他吗？当然认识！

1341
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:47,440
I know Umut. I know Seyfi.

1342
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:47,440
我认识乌穆特  我也认识塞菲

1343
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:50,600
All of Kambura knows you.

1344
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:50,600
坎布拉的所有人都认识你们

1345
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:52,400
Everybody used to love you.

1346
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:52,400
每个人曾经都很爱你们

1347
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:55,120
"Look at the triplets!" they'd say.

1348
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:55,120
他们会说“快看，是三胞胎！”

1349
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:58,840
I don't want to keep you much longer. Please get back to what you were doing.

1350
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:58,840
我不想耽搁你太久  请你继续

1351
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:01,000
I'll just be standing here.

1352
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:01,000
我就只是站在这里

1353
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:07,480
- Can I have the knife back, please? - Take it.

1354
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:07,480
-请把刀还给我  -给你

1355
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:10,000
Thank you very much.

1356
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:10,000
非常感谢

1357
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:19,560
He isn't here! Clear the road!

1358
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:19,560
他不在这里！离开这里！

1359
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:21,840
Clear the road! Ufuk ran away!

1360
00:50:19,640 --> 00:50:21,840
离开这里！乌福克逃跑了！

1361
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:24,560
Clear the road so we can find him!

1362
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:24,560
离开这里，方便我们找他！

1363
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:28,960
We aren't going anywhere.

1364
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:28,960
我们哪都不会去

1365
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:32,480
We aren't going anywhere without Ufuk. Where is he?

1366
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:32,480
没有乌福克我们哪都不去  他在哪里？

1367
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:37,000
He's in the car, I know it! Let's overwhelm them and get him!

1368
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:37,000
他在车上，我就知道！让他们不知所措，把他救出来！

1369
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:42,920
Let's go.

1370
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:42,920
我们走吧

1371
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,560
Are they launching fireworks or something?

1372
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,560
他们是在放烟花吗？

1373
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:52,560
- Would you like some help, son? - Don't come any closer. Stay right there.

1374
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:52,560
-你需要帮忙吗？孩子？-别靠近了

1375
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:54,800
It's funny.

1376
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:54,800
很有趣

1377
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:59,520
I went to see a play the other day.

1378
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:59,520
前几天我去看话剧

1379
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:01,760
There was a scene that resembled this.

1380
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:01,760
有一个类似于这个的场景

1381
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:05,400
Not exactly, but close.

1382
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:05,400
不完全相同，但很接近

1383
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:08,440
I didn't find it believable at first,

1384
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:08,440
一开始我觉得不可信

1385
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:11,080
but I think they might've had a point.

1386
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:11,080
但我现在认为他们说的有点道理

1387
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:16,560
They said that conscience resembles the gut.

1388
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:16,560
他们说良心很像内心

1389
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:19,480
And the gut resembles conscience.

1390
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:19,480
内脏就像良心

1391
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:24,320
If you want it emptied, you have to be the one to do it.

1392
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:24,320
如果你想让它空出来，你就必须自杀

1393
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:28,080
Funny. See...

1394
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:28,080
很有趣  你看……

1395
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:31,120
I prepared this for you.

1396
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:31,120
我为你准备了这个

1397
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:33,480
To stick on your forehead.

1398
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:33,480
贴在额头上

1399
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:36,120
But since you're going to be the one to do it,

1400
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:36,120
但是既然你将要自杀了

1401
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:37,840
I wouldn't want to disrespect you.

1402
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:37,840
我不想不尊重你

1403
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:41,920
I wouldn't want to get between you and your conscience.

1404
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:41,920
我不想介于你和你的良心之间

1405
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,320
That's why I won't.

1406
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,320
那就是我不会干涉你的原因

1407
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:47,080
Go on.

1408
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:47,080
继续

1409
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:50,600
I wonder which of us is the crazier one. Leave me alone.

1410
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:50,600
我想知道我们中谁是最疯狂的  走开！

1411
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:56,720
- Would you like some help? - Stay right there!

1412
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:56,720
-你需要帮助吗？-别过来！

1413
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,920
Sure. But don't tarry.

1414
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,920
当然可以，但别拖延了

1415
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:02,040
The cops are looking for you. They might be here soon.

1416
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:02,040
警察正在找你  他们可能很快就会来

1417
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:25,280
Make it quick. Raise yourself. Just like this, see?

1418
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:25,280
快点  把自己吊起来，就像这样，懂吗？

1419
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:28,480
Not like that. Get on your tippy-toes.

1420
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:28,480
不是那样的，小心点

1421
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:30,440
That's it!

1422
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:30,440
对了！

1423
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:32,280
Let yourself go!

1424
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:32,280
松手把！

1425
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:37,840
Kill yourself and be done with it. No more pangs of conscience, Ufuk.

1426
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:37,840
结束自己的生命吧  不再有良心的痛苦  乌福克

1427
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:39,440
Go on, don't be scared.

1428
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:39,440
继续，不要害怕

1429
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:41,120
Go on!

1430
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:41,120
继续！

1431
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:45,520
Where are you?

1432
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:45,520
哪去了？

1433
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:05,320
It's funny.

1434
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:05,320
真有趣

1435
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:09,400
This is exactly how I taught my daughter to swim.

1436
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:09,400
这正是我教我女儿游泳的方法

1437
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:11,960
We were in Erdek.

1438
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:11,960
我们在埃尔德克

1439
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:14,920
She was on the pontoon. I was in the water.

1440
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:14,920
她在船上  我在水里

1441
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:17,720
I kept telling her to jump.

1442
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:17,720
我让她跳下来

1443
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:21,560
She refused to do it.

1444
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:21,560
她不跳

1445
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:24,400
I told her I was right there, there was nothing to be scared of.

1446
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:24,400
我告诉她我就在那里，没有什么可害怕的

1447
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:29,400
Come on, come to papa.

1448
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:29,400
来吧，到爸爸这来

1449
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:33,800
Let yourself go.

1450
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:33,800
放自己走

1451
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:35,920
Come on in.

1452
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:35,920
来吧

1453
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:43,040
That's it! That was some jump.

1454
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:43,040
就是这样！

1455
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:46,120
Zuhal wouldn't jump.

1456
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:46,120
祖哈尔不会跳

1457
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,920
She just froze.

1458
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,920
她只是呆在那里

1459
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:53,080
My little girl wouldn't trust her father.

1460
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:53,080
我的小女儿不相信她的父亲

1461
00:53:57,080 --> 00:53:59,040
She was wise beyond her years.

1462
00:53:57,080 --> 00:53:59,040
她拥有她的年龄不应拥有的智慧

1463
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:15,000
DOG SLAYER

1464
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:15,000
狗杀手
